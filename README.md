# Speedrun - Test

A speedrun is a play-through (or a recording thereof, namely run) of a video game performed with the intention of completing it as fast as possible within one's own ability.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrun)

You must develop a web app that shows the world records speedruns. Your task is to extract the information from [speedrun](http://www.speedrun.com) using its api: [speedrun-api](http://www.speedrun.com/api/v1/games)

The app must:

Show a list with the games. You must show the game logo and the game name. There is no need to implement pagination.
When you select a game in the list, it must open a new screen containing information of the first run in the api runs list. The screen must contain:
a button to see the video in an outside web,
the name of the player (if there is more than one, you must show only the first playerâ€™s name),
the time of that run,
the game logo and,
the game name.

## Requirements

  - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as package manager


## Start

First, install all dependencies by running the following command on your project directory:

```bash
npm install
```

You can run the app in the development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

## Architecture

In this section, I'm going to explain how the app was structured. The first thing I want to point is how to split a component. Usually, a component can be split in a container and a component, container states for the component's logic and the component states for the presentation/visual of the component.

### Modules

The main modules that you can found in the app are:
* [./core](https://github.com/bilaluali/speedrun-list-app/tree/master/src/modules/core): as the name describes, includes the core components of the application such as the redux config, the router...
* [./material-ui](https://github.com/bilaluali/speedrun-list-app/tree/master/src/modules/material-ui): custom material-ui theme.
* [./models](https://github.com/bilaluali/speedrun-list-app/tree/master/src/modules/models): includes the redux files for each application entity.
* [./game](https://github.com/bilaluali/speedrun-list-app/tree/master/src/modules/game): usually we will define a module per entity where we will define the containers and components related to the entity.
* [./ui](https://github.com/bilaluali/speedrun-list-app/tree/master/src/modules/ui): "core" components that will be used among the entire application. This module should include few components such as Page, AppBar... Everything else should be placed in ```material-ui``` module.

### Route example

If you're not familiar with this architecture, it may be confusing to know where to start checking the files for a concrete route. Hence, in the image below, you can see a tree showing the differnt components for games route. Please note in the diagram I avoided putting in the tree both, the component and the container. So that, if the component has a container, first check the container.
